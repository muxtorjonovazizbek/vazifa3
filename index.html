It seems like people are just looking for someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are just loooking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less then respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any any relationship grow is by showing  respect.
                <div class="right__p__two"> I have come to the conculision that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or hihg regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.</div>
